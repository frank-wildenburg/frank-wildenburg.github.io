Hi! I am currently a full-time teacher (docent-4) at the University of Amsterdam, where I teach in the bachelor of artificial intelligence. Before starting this job, I was a student at the [Master of Logic](https://msclogic.illc.uva.nl), an interdisciplinary research master at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation. During these two years, I focused on artificial intelligence and philosophy of exact sciences. Before that, I did my bachelor's degree in artificial intelligence at Utrecht University. Besides teaching at the UvA, I recently finished [a paper based on my MSc thesis](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-acl.572/).
