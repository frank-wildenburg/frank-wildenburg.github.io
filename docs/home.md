Hi! I am currently a full-time teacher (docent-4) at the University of Amsterdam, where I teach in the bachelor of artificial intelligence. Before starting this job, I was a student at the [Master of Logic](https://msclogic.illc.uva.nl), an interdisciplinary research master at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation. During these two years, I focused on artificial intelligence and philosophy of exact sciences. Before that, I did my bachelor's degree in artificial intelligence at Utrecht University. Besides teaching at the UvA, I am currently working on [a paper based on my MSc thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12486).

## Updates

- Started this website :)
