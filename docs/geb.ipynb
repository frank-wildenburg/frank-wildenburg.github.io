    "Starting in the summer of 2025, Wouter van Etteger and I co-organized a reading group for the classic book _Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid_ by Douglas Hofstadter. Our intent was to read through the book in eight months, discussing the book through four digital meetings and a group chat, and finishing by visiting a performance of _Die Kunst der Fuge_ by Bach, one of the works discussed in the book. On this page,you can find the chapter notes I wrote for this group.\n",

One of the main parts of the introduction is introducing the main 'subjects' of the book, all of whom will be extensively covered throughout the rest of the book:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bach, the musician, known (amongst other things) for creating fugas\n",
    "* Escher, the artist, known for creating (seemingly) paradoxical artworks\n",
    "* Gödel, the logician, known for a Gödel's theorem, which says formal systems cannot be both complete and consistent\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main characteristics linking the above is the concept of the Strange Loop. Hofstadter defines such a loop as a (hierarchical) system where we can arrive at the starting 'level' by consistently 'heading in one direction'. We can see this in Bach (arriving back at a note after going consistently up from this note), in Escher (returning at a previous point of a staircase after only going up), and in Gödel (by representing statements about numbers as numbers themselves). \n",
    "\n",
    "Hofstadter then describes how this concept has been a challenge to (mathematical) logic in the previous century, finally arriving at computers and the concept of (artificial) intelligence. Hofdstadter's main claim here is that Strange Loops form the core of the concept of intelligence.\n",

    "Reading tip: when describing Bach, Hofstadter introduces the term 'ricercar', a type of fugue, but also meaning 'searching'. This term refers to riddles and games hidden in Bach's fugas, but just as much to GEB itself. Indeed, the book contains many hidden messages, some of which are later made explicit, while others remain hidden. When reading the book, it is a good exercise to try to spot these riddles. For example, can you find the link to (the name of) Chapter 1 hidden in the Three-Part Intervention?\n",

In essence, a formal system consists of 1) starting theorems, called axioms, and 2) rules for deriving new theorems from existing theorems. A step-by-step demonstration of deriving a theorem is called a derivation. A derivation also proves its final theorem.\n",

    "  \n",
    "  This chapter discusses the link between formal systems and reality; the 'meaning' of formal systems. Hofstadter does so by introducing a new formal system, the pq-system, that corresponds to some part of reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "  An important distinction made by Hofstadter is that a statement corresponding to some part of reality does not mean that statement 'means' that part of reality. Rather, we say that there is an isomorphism between a system and reality - some correspondence, or translation, that preserves some structure (in this case, the correspondence that all theorems are true when interpreted).\n",
    "\n",
    "  The specific correspondence chosen is called an interpretation. An interpretation can be meaningful (corresponding to some part of reality), or meaningless (in which case theorems sound no 'better' or 'true' than non-theorems). \n",
    "\n",
    "  We can also distinguish active and passive meanings of a system. If a meaning is active, we can use it to create new rules in the system. If a meaning is passive, we may choose a meaning (e.g., based on isomorphisms), but not create new rules/theorems for the system. For example, in a formal system, we may not create new rules or theorems based on their meaning even if they seem true! Doing so would result in a different formal system, after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Of course, we would like our formal systems to be as meaningful as possible, i.e., correspond to reality as much as possible. For example, as a mathematician, we would like to have a formal system representing ideal numbers to be as close to 'real' numbers as possible. But nevertheless, reality and formal systems are independent from each other - only the interpretation of the formal system through an isomorphism connects them.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Reading tip: the book (for now) mainly considers formal systems of mathematics, but formal systems exist in all parts of the world. For example, the weather prediction as a formal system of the real weather. Try to think about why you can consider things like this a formal system.\n",

    "  When doing so, it's tempting to use something 'not being a theorem' as a fact in proving something else being a theorem. For example, using something not being divisible as a way to prove something is prime. Yet doing so is an oversimplification, and in some cases, not possible at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Hofstadter illustrates this using a comparison with art. In this comparison, theorems can be seen as the positive space of a work, and non-theorems as the negative space. Yet just as there negative spaces that are not the positive space of some other work, there are also formal systems whose set of non-theorems are not the set of theorems of any formal system (formally: some recursively enumerable sets are not recursive).\n",

    "\n",
    "  Consistency can either mean that the formal system doesn't contradict the real world (external consistency), or that it doesn't contradict itself (internal consistency).  For example, a formal system might be externally inconsistent if it says that Mount Everest isn't the highest mountain, and internally inconsistent if Mount Everest both is and isn't the highest mountain at the same time. Completeness, meanwhile, says that all real-world statements expressible in our formal system are also theorems of that formal system. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Hofstadter emphasizes that both completeness and consistency are properties of the interpretation of a formal system, not the formal system itself. For example, two theorems that seem contradictory (and would therefore break internal consistency) might be perfectly fine when given the right interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "  However, it is difficult to tell whether we have the right interpretation. This is especially difficult when concepts in our formal system are also 'normal' words used in everyday language. Hofstadter illustrates this using non-Euclidean geometry as an example. For many years, people thought these geometries were inconsistent, only to eventually find out that they are not when we consider the right meaning of terms like 'point' and 'line'.\n",
    "\n",
    "  An important theorem about completeness and consistency is Gödel's Theorem, which says that there is no complete and consistent 'strong' axiomatic system.

Hofstadter, however, argues that this simply means we have unrealistic expectations.\n",

    "\n",
    "  Hofstadter starts by introducing some terminology, originating from computer science. When dealing with recursion, 'push' means to 'rise a level deeper' - to start a new task, while remembering the details of your old task. To 'pop' is the opposite: to finish work on one level and 'return' to the point you left on a previous level. Information about these levels - which tasks are involved and where you are in these tasks - is stored on a 'stack'.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Hofstadter then gives many examples of recursion:\n",
    "  * In music (like Bach's Kleines harmonisches Labyrinth)\n",
    "  * In language (like a noun which contains a noun somewhere, like \"the strange bagels that *the purple cow without horns* gobbled\")\n",
    "  * In mathematics (like the Fibonacci sequence)\n",
    "  * In physics (properties of the behaviour of particles)\n",
    "  * In art (Escher)\n",
    "  * In games (strategies in Chess)\n",
    "  These concepts can also be graphically represented, for example with Recursive Transition Networks (RTNs).\n",
    "\n",
    "  In some way, the 'levels' of recursion are 'the same', in that they share some properties. At the same time, however, they do differ. In particular, a new level of recursion is almost always going to be _simpler_ than a previous level, and it's this that allows recursive behaviours to 'bottom out' and finish - i.e., this is what makes a recursive definition different from a circular definition.\n",

    "\n",
    "  For this discussion, Hofstadter introduces three levels of messages:\n",
    "  1. The frame message, which simply communicates that something _is_ a message\n",
    "  2. The outer message, which communicates how the message should be decoded\n",
    "  3. The inner message, which is the 'intended' message\n",
    "\n",
    "  In 'normal' messages, only the inner message is explicitly recognized, but when a message is more abstract or encoded, we start to need more help from the other levels. For example, to turn DNA into a creature, or decode a message from aliens, we will a) first need to understand whether (and where) there even is a message, b) then need to understand how to interpret this message, and c) finally need to actually understand the intended meaning. This is made even more difficult if the encoded message doesn't have the same structure as the meaning. For example, a creature might have a certain fingerprint without having a 'fingerprint-gene'. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Reading tip: you may also compare this to the distinction between formal systems and their interpretation in chapter 2 \n",
    "\n",
    "  The main question Hofstadter asks in this chapter is \"is the meaning of a message located entirely in the message?\". For something like a book, it seems logical that the meaning remains the same even if it is read by someone else or somewhere else. But is the same true for a strand of DNA that might develop completely differently when placed in a different chemical environment? Hofstadter's answer: some forms of messages are so inherent/universal that all forms of intelligence will be able to understand them, and hence (only) these messages can be said to have an 'intrinsic' meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Reading tip: the idea of having to communicate with aliens is a good aid for understanding the three levels of a message. Try thinking how you would do such communication: what would make clear that there _is_ a message, how would the aliens learn how to _decode_ it, and how would they then _understand_ it? \n",

Another nice property of the system is that is has a decision procedure (although it is not covered in the book).\n",

TNT essentially encodes the five Peano-axioms, five \"semi-formal\" statements about the natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3,...) made by Giuseppe Peano. \n",

    "  \n",
    "  We have seen that both formal systems (e.g., the self-reference in TNT) and human thought (the 'self' as part of the brain) involve self-reference. For formal-systems, this self-reference was only relevant for 'sufficiently strong' formal systems. But what does that mean? For formal systems, a sufficient condition for being 'sufficiently strong' is containing all primitive recursive truths. This chapter aims to illustrate this concept, as well as related terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "  To do so, the chapter introduces a number of programming languages. The first one of these is BlooP. BlooP can do some things typical of programming language: adding, multiplying and comparing numbers, branch based on 'if-statements', and do things multiple times using 'loops'. Its defining characteristic, however, is that these loops can only 'loop' a pre-defined number of times. In other words, if you tell a BlooP-programme to 'do something n times', then the number n must be known before starting the loop!\n",
    "\n",
    "  Reading tip: the book provides a syntax for the programming languages, but this really doesn't matter too much, so skip it if necessary - it's the expressiveness of the different languages that matters most\n",
    "\n",
    "  It turns out the functions one can express in BlooP are precisely the primitive recursive functions. In other words, TNT, being sufficiently strong, has all positive BlooP tests as theorems, and all negative BlooP tests as nontheorems. But does that mean everything can be expressed as a BlooP test? It turns out that is not true. Using a method called the _diagonal method_, we can create functions which are well-defined, but also (provably) not valid BlooP programmes. \n",
    "\n",
    "  What if we drop the boundedness of loops that defines BlooP? This language might be stronger, but it has a downside: it might contain programmes that never stop. And, in fact, Turing showed that we can also never know whether a programme will stop or not (or at least, there is no general-purpose test that decides this for any programme). Should we move on to an even stronger language, then? The so-called _Church-Turing Thesis_ argues that such languages do not exist - and, at the very least, we know that no such language has ever been found.\n",

    "  Remember when chapter 9 claimed we could create some sentence 'G' that could lead to either inconsistency or incompleteness? This chapter discusses how it is that we can create such a sentence in TNT.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The core of the idea is what Hofstadter calls 'arithmoquining'. This consists of taking a sentence in TNT - in particular, a sentence with one variable - and 'inserting' that sentence into itself using Gödel numbering. This results in the sentence 'talking about itself', the form of self-reference that results in Godel's theorems.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Reading tip: once again, the dialogue preceding the chapter gives a good introduction on what the chapter discusses formally. The main difference to keep in mind is that G does while being a number, instead of text. \n",
    "\n",
    "  In fact, Gödel's second incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system can prove it's own consistency. This is also where omega-inconsistency comes back: we cannot prove G, which is a claim about all natural numbers, yet for each _individual_ number we _can_ prove this claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "  So what do we do now? We could consider expanding TNT in two ways: either by accepting G as a new axiom (the 'standard' extension), or by accepting the negation of G as a new axiom. The latter seems contradictory - how can something be true for all individual natural numbers but not for all numbers? - yet we handle this by accepting 'supernatural numbers', numbers that exist 'beyond' infinity.\n",

    "  \n",
    "  So why don't we just add G to our formal system? Well, it turns out that in this formal system - TNT+G - we can repeat the same trick to create new undecidable sentences G'. And so on, ad infinitum. The same happens if we add the negation of G, or even if we try to add the entire \"pattern\" of G at once. TNT can be said to suffer from an _essential incompleteness_, one that cannot be eliminated. \n",
    "\n",
    "  This fact was used by J.R. Lucas to argue that the human mind cannot be interpreted as a machine (i.e., that there are things that humans can do but computers cannot). For we as humans can use this mechanism to _always_ create a statement that is true, but cannot be generated (i.e., \"understood\") by computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "  But is this true? Hofstadter argues it is not. If there is no algorithm that can describe how to \"Gödelize\" any system, then at one point this procedure will become too complicated for humans as well. \n",
