    "After traveling to various cultural sites for some years, I found a rule of thumb for finding good spots to visit: check if something is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Sometimes this leads to obvious suggestions (Vatican City, Paris, Amsterdam) but more often than not visiting world heritage sites has shown me sites that are very much worth visiting but not as touristy as the usual sites (e.g., Bologna, Orange, Albi).\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, my enthousiasm led to the dream of visiting all world heritage sites in Europe, but this dream soon showed to be too ambitious. All EU countries then? Still quite a lot. Some narrowing down brought me to the following goal: visit all world heritage sites in the continental part of the original member states of the European Union. Achievable, but also ambitious, with Germany, France and Italy as the biggest obstacles. Since then, I've been using this as a heuristic in planning vacations.\n",
