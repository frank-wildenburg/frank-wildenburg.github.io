One of the main parts of the introduction is introducing the main 'subjects' of the book, all of whom will be extensively covered throughout the rest of the book:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bach, the musician, known (amongst other things) for creating fugas\n",
    "* Escher, the artist, known for creating (seemingly) paradoxical artworks\n",
    "* Gödel, the logician, known for a Gödel's theorem, which says formal systems cannot be both complete and consistent\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main characteristics linking the above is the concept of the Strange Loop. Hofstadter defines such a loop as a (hierarchical) system where we can arrive at the starting 'level' by consistently 'heading in one direction'. We can see this in Bach (arriving back at a note after going consistently up from this note), in Escher (returning at a previous point of a staircase after only going up), and in Gödel (by representing statements about numbers as numbers themselves). \n",
    "\n",
    "Hofstadter then describes how this concept has been a challenge to (mathematical) logic in the previous century, finally arriving at computers and the concept of (artificial) intelligence. Hofdstadter's main claim here is that Strange Loops form the core of the concept of intelligence.\n",
    "\n",

    "Reading tip: when describing Bach, Hofstadter introduces the term 'ricercar', a type of fugue, but also meaning 'searching'. This term refers to riddles and games hidden in Bach's fugas, but just as much to GEB itself. Indeed, the book contains many hidden messages, some of which are later made explicit, while others remain hidden. When reading the book, it is a good exercise to try to spot these riddles. For example, can you find the link to (the name of) Chapter 1 hidden in the Three-Part Intervention?\n",

In essence, a formal system consists of 1) starting theorems, called axioms, and 2) rules for deriving new theorems from existing theorems. A step-by-step demonstration of deriving a theorem is called a derivation. A derivation also proves its final theorem.\n",

Outside (and only outside) of a formal system we can use our intelligence to reason about a system - but we do so using knowledge that is not contained in the system! For humans, reasoning 'outside' the system is done almost automatically\n",

    "  This chapter discusses the link between formal systems and reality; the 'meaning' of formal systems. Hofstadter does so by introducing a new formal system, the pq-system, that corresponds to some part of reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "  An important distinction made by Hofstadter is that a statement corresponding to some part of reality does not mean that statement 'means' that part of reality. Rather, we say that there is an isomorphism between a system and reality - some correspondence, or translation, that preserves some structure (in this case, the correspondence that all theorems are true when interpreted).\n",
    "\n",
    "  The specific correspondence chosen is called an interpretation. An interpretation can be meaningful (corresponding to some part of reality), or meaningless (in which case theorems sound no 'better' or 'true' than non-theorems). \n",
    "\n",
    "  We can also distinguish active and passive meanings of a system. If a meaning is active, we can use it to create new rules in the system. If a meaning is passive, we may choose a meaning (e.g., based on isomorphisms), but not create new rules/theorems for the system. For example, in a formal system, we may not create new rules or theorems based on their meaning even if they seem true! Doing so would result in a different formal system, after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Of course, we would like our formal systems to be as meaningful as possible, i.e., correspond to reality as much as possible. For example, as a mathematician, we would like to have a formal system representing ideal numbers to be as close to 'real' numbers as possible. But nevertheless, reality and formal systems are independent from each other - only the interpretation of the formal system through an isomorphism connects them.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Reading tip: the book (for now) mainly considers formal systems of mathematics, but formal systems exist in all parts of the world. For example, the weather prediction as a formal system of the real weather. Try to think about why you can consider things like this a formal system.\n",

    "\n",
    "  Hofstadter illustrates this using a comparison with art. In this comparison, theorems can be seen as the positive space of a work, and non-theorems as the negative space. Yet just as there negative spaces that are not the positive space of some other work, there are also formal systems whose set of non-theorems are not the set of theorems of any formal system (formally: some recursively enumerable sets are not recursive).\n",

    "  In very broad terms, this chapter is about properties that we might want (an interpretation of) a formal system to have: consistency and completeness. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Consistency can either mean that the formal system doesn't contradict the real world (external consistency), or that it doesn't contradict itself (internal consistency).  For example, a formal system might be externally inconsistent if it says that Mount Everest isn't the highest mountain, and internally inconsistent if Mount Everest both is and isn't the highest mountain at the same time. Completeness, meanwhile, says that all real-world statements expressible in our formal system are also theorems of that formal system. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Hofstadter emphasizes that both completeness and consistency are properties of the interpretation of a formal system, not the formal system itself. For example, two theorems that seem contradictory (and would therefore break internal consistency) might be perfectly fine when given the right interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "  However, it is difficult to tell whether we have the right interpretation. This is especially difficult when concepts in our formal system are also 'normal' words used in everyday language. Hofstadter illustrates this using non-Euclidean geometry as an example. For many years, people thought these geometries were inconsistent, only to eventually find out that they are not when we consider the right meaning of terms like 'point' and 'line'.\n",
    "\n",
    "  An important theorem about completeness and consistency is Gödel's Theorem, which says that there is no complete and consistent 'strong' axiomatic system. This theorem is isomorphically illustrated by the Contracrostipunctus. For some, this is seen as a big problem. Hofstadter, however, argues that this simply means we have unrealistic expectations.\n",

    "  Chapter 5 concerns the concept of recursion. Recursion is a property where something (a sentence, a song, etc.) contains a smaller, possibly varied version of itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Hofstadter starts by introducing some terminology, originating from computer science. When dealing with recursion, 'push' means to 'rise a level deeper' - to start a new task, while remembering the details of your old task. To 'pop' is the opposite: to finish work on one level and 'return' to the point you left on a previous level. Information about these levels - which tasks are involved and where you are in these tasks - is stored on a 'stack'.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Hofstadter then gives many examples of recursion:\n",
    "  * In music (like Bach's Kleines harmonisches Labyrinth)\n",
    "  * In language (like a noun which contains a noun somewhere, like \"the strange bagels that *the purple cow without horns* gobbled\")\n",
    "  * In mathematics (like the Fibonacci sequence)\n",
    "  * In physics (properties of the behaviour of particles)\n",
    "  * In art (Escher)\n",
    "  * In games (strategies in Chess)\n",
    "  These concepts can also be graphically represented, for example with Recursive Transition Networks (RTNs).\n",
    "\n",
    "  In some way, the 'levels' of recursion are 'the same', in that they share some properties. At the same time, however, they do differ. In particular, a new level of recursion is almost always going to be _simpler_ than a previous level, and it's this that allows recursive behaviours to 'bottom out' and finish - i.e., this is what makes a recursive definition different from a circular definition.\n",

    "  Having discussed what makes two things 'the same', we now discuss whether one thing can be 'different' - in particular, whether the meaning of a message is inherent to that message, or also dependent on a mechanism interpreting it. \n",
    "\n",
    "  For this discussion, Hofstadter introduces three levels of messages:\n",
    "  1. The frame message, which simply communicates that something _is_ a message\n",
    "  2. The outer message, which communicates how the message should be decoded\n",
    "  3. The inner message, which is the 'intended' message\n",
    "\n",
    "  In 'normal' messages, only the inner message is explicitly recognized, but when a message is more abstract or encoded, we start to need more help from the other levels. For example, to turn DNA into a creature, or decode a message from aliens, we will a) first need to understand whether (and where) there even is a message, b) then need to understand how to interpret this message, and c) finally need to actually understand the intended meaning. This is made even more difficult if the encoded message doesn't have the same structure as the meaning. For example, a creature might have a certain fingerprint without having a 'fingerprint-gene'. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Reading tip: you may also compare this to the distinction between formal systems and their interpretation in chapter 2 \n",
    "\n",
    "  The main question Hofstadter asks in this chapter is \"is the meaning of a message located entirely in the message?\". For something like a book, it seems logical that the meaning remains the same even if it is read by someone else or somewhere else. But is the same true for a strand of DNA that might develop completely differently when placed in a different chemical environment? Hofstadter's answer: some forms of messages are so inherent/universal that all forms of intelligence will be able to understand them, and hence (only) these messages can be said to have an 'intrinsic' meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Reading tip: the idea of having to communicate with aliens is a good aid for understanding the three levels of a message. Try thinking how you would do such communication: what would make clear that there _is_ a message, how would the aliens learn how to _decode_ it, and how would they then _understand_ it? \n",

Another nice property of the system is that is has a decision procedure (although it is not covered in the book).\n",

TNT essentially encodes the five Peano-axioms, five \"semi-formal\" statements about the natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3,...) made by Giuseppe Peano. \n",

Because of this, we conclude that TNT is a so-called omega-inconsistent system (although note that this is less bad than 'normal' inconsistency. In fact, we could introduce \"not 0+n=n\" without introducing inconsistency). \n",
